This a SpringBoot project, I developed this project to get some handson about API, how we can connect SpringBoot and SQL. 
This system will store the details of actiive students taking the courses and their fee. 
We can edit the details if he/she changes the course.
We can delete the student details if he/she drops or completes the course.
 
Used SpringBoot, MySQL, HTML, CSS, XAMPP, PHPADMIN to develop this project.
